# Primaages - Back End

A simple image gallery API made as a test project with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) version 4.18.1.

At the top of the backlog:

- sessions: access & refresh tokens bug fix
- deployment (Heroku + Docker)

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. The server is on `http://localhost:8080/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
